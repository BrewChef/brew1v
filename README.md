Single Vessle Brewery Contoller (Brew 1v)
===================

A dashboard for brewery control, built using [Node-RED](https://github.com/node-red/node-red) running on a Raspberry Pi.

### About

This Node-RED dashboard started as a fork from Justin Angevaare's Brew2 project and incorporates nodes and flows from Eric Nordfeldt.

Support for adapting this dashboard to your own brewery/process will be limited. There are many great resources for learning about Node-RED. I've attempted to make flows as readable as possible, and to separate major features into individual flows. 

I am not currently looking for contributors, though I encourage forks of this project, and raising issues to address bugs.

You are free to use my work in whichever way you like, understanding that I accept no liability relating to its use.

#### Development

Currently implementing Brewfather batch recipe import and mash step automation.
